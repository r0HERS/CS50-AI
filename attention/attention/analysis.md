# Analysis

## Layer 2, Head 5

### Observations:
In Layer 11, Head 21, I observed that adjectives tend to pay attention to the nouns they describe.

### Example Sentences:

## Layer 6, Head 3

### Observations:
In Layer 6, Head 12, I observed that prepositions tend to pay attention to the verbs they follow. For example, in the sentence "He sat on the [MASK] chair," this attention head shows a clear focus from the preposition "on" to the verb "sat."

### Example Sentences:
- He sat on the [MASK] chair.
- The cat is under the [MASK] table.
